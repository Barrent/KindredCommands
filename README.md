# KindredCommands for V Rising
KindredCommands is a server modification for V Rising that adds chat commands for the goal of server administration.
This is built upon CommunityCommands by deca, and AdminCommands by willis with some fixes/tweaks and new commands added. Credits to all of them for their work and inspiration. 
Also, thanks to the V Rising modding and server communities for ideas and requests!
